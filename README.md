# Overview

This project aims to build a daily gold price prediction model by combining two powerful approaches:

- Prophet: A time series forecasting model that captures trend, seasonality, and holiday effects.

- XGBoost: A machine learning model used to predict the residuals (errors) that Prophet does not explain.

By integrating these two methods, the goal is to enhance forecasting accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both statistical and machine learning techniques.
