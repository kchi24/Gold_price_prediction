Overview

This project aims to build a daily gold price prediction model by combining two powerful approaches:

Prophet: A time series forecasting model that captures trend, seasonality, and holiday effects.

XGBoost: A machine learning model used to predict the residuals (errors) that Prophet fails to capture.

The goal is to improve forecasting accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both models.
